This is my final graduation project ðŸŽ“ for the Spring 2022 semesteer in [CS159: Introduction to Parallel Processing](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/robert.chun/courses/cs159/index.html) at San JosÃ© State University during my study abroad. I made a 25 minutes [talk]() and a [paper](), I had the honor that my project was under the supervision of Prof. [Robert K Chun](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/robert.chun/)

# Content
The paper aims to explain Python's and Go's way of dealing with concurrency and parallelism. I went through the following concepts:
- Deep dive into Python internals "GIL, How is everything is an Object in Python, Threds, Subprocesses"
- Deep dive into Go Internals "Goroutines, channels, select, WorkerPool Pattern"
